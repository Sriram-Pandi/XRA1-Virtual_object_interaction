## 📌 Project Summary
**XR App 1** is a **virtual object interaction prototype** designed for **Meta Quest VR**. The app enables users to **interact with 3D objects using controllers**, featuring realistic **grabbing, cloning, destroying, and coloring interactions**. It serves as a **foundational project** for developing **immersive XR experiences**, making it ideal for **VR training, simulations, and design applications**.

## 🔹 Key Features
- **🎨 Custom Environment:** Unique skybox, floor, shelves, and platforms for object interactions.  
- **🕹️ Navigation & Controllers:** Left controller for teleportation with a reticle; right controller for object interactions.  
- **🔊 Realistic Feedback:** Haptic feedback and sound effects for object selection, movement, and collisions.  
- **⚡ Object Interactions:**  
  - **Highlighting:** Selected objects change color dynamically.  
  - **Cloning:** Duplicate objects using a button press.  
  - **Destroying:** Remove objects with an animated effect and sound feedback.  
- **🎨 Color Wand Feature:** A wand tool that dynamically changes its tip color and applies it to interactable objects on touch.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Unity** with **Meta’s XR SDK**
- **VR physics-based interactions**
- **C# scripting for object manipulation**

This project serves as a **foundation for more advanced XR applications**, including **3D design tools, interactive simulations, and virtual training environments**.
